# Start Here: Employer Setup Roadmap

Setting up as an employer involves more than just hiring your first worker. You need to register your business, get federal and state tax IDs, and put systems in place to collect and remit payroll taxes. This roadmap walks you through every critical step so you can start paying employees with confidence. It is designed for busy small‑business owners who want an operational checklist, not fluff.

## Key takeaways

- Form your legal entity before applying for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) and gather foundational documents for recordkeeping.
- Apply for an EIN online using the IRS assistance tool; it’s free and should be done right after you register your business【509945751630823†L282-L301】.
- Register for state employer accounts—both withholding and unemployment insurance—using your EIN and business details; some states require registration once you pay a threshold amount of wages【575894343363303†L94-L100】.
- Have new employees complete Form W‑4 for federal income tax withholding and verify their eligibility to work using Form I‑9【62666536645171†L373-L379】【62666536645171†L405-L423】.
- Report new hires to your state’s directory within 20 days and keep payroll records and tax deposits for at least four years【905240524717134†L215-L221】【143267306823543†L369-L394】.
- Maintain workers’ compensation insurance once you have employees; many states require coverage for even one worker【378964714632368†L164-L174】.

## Who this is for

- First‑time employers setting up payroll in the United States.
- Business owners expanding from sole proprietor to having employees.
- Entrepreneurs who have hired contractors and need guidance on employee compliance.
- Anyone who wants a clear, step‑by‑step checklist to stay compliant with federal and state requirements.

## What you need before you start

- **Business formation documents** – articles of organization or incorporation filed with your state.
- **Legal name and addresses** – your business’s legal name, physical and mailing addresses.
- **Responsible party information** – name, Social Security number, and contact details for the person who will represent the business when applying for the EIN【245012602743022†L425-L437】.
- **Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN)** – if you have employees you’ll need one; apply after forming your entity【509945751630823†L282-L301】.
- **Bank account** – a dedicated business bank account to remit payroll taxes and pay employees.
- **Payroll start date and average wages** – the date you expect to start paying employees and estimated payroll amounts (needed for state registrations).
- **Industry classification** – your NAICS code, used by some states for unemployment insurance registration.

## Step‑by‑step: employer setup

1. **Form your legal entity and collect formation documents**  
   **What to do:** Register your business as an LLC, corporation or other entity with your state’s filing office. Most states require you to form your entity before requesting an EIN【245012602743022†L425-L437】. Keep copies of your articles and any operating agreements.  
   **What to save for your records:** Store your filed articles of organization or incorporation and any state‑issued certificates in a secure folder.

2. **Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN)**  
   **What to do:** Use the IRS’s online EIN assistant to apply for an EIN once your entity is formed. The application is free and provides your nine‑digit EIN immediately upon verification【509945751630823†L282-L301】. The tool is available daily, but only one EIN per responsible party may be issued per day【245012602743022†L409-L437】. Provide your legal name, business structure, responsible party information and mailing address.  
   **What to save for your records:** Save the EIN confirmation letter (Form CP 575) and any emails confirming your EIN assignment.

3. **Register for state employer accounts (withholding and unemployment insurance)**  
   **What to do:** Each state requires employers to register for payroll withholding and unemployment insurance once liability thresholds are met. For example, New York requires employers to register for unemployment insurance when they pay remuneration of $300 in a quarter and obtain a Federal EIN before registering【575894343363303†L94-L100】【575894343363303†L159-L164】. Access your state’s employer portal to create accounts for tax withholding and unemployment insurance. Provide your EIN, business addresses, industry classification and date you first paid wages. Some states also handle new hire reporting through these portals.  
   **What to save for your records:** Keep confirmation of your state withholding account number and unemployment insurance account number, plus any registration certificates.

4. **Classify workers and collect new hire forms**  
   **What to do:** Determine whether your workers are employees or independent contractors using the IRS common‑law rules. Factors include behavioral control, financial control and the type of relationship【402717181658816†L414-L437】. For employees, collect a signed Form W‑4 to determine federal tax withholding【62666536645171†L405-L423】. Verify each employee’s identity and work authorization using Form I‑9; both employer and employee must complete the form【62666536645171†L373-L379】. Record each employee’s legal name and Social Security number, which must be shown on their Form W‑2【62666536645171†L385-L397】. Schedule pay periods that align with your state’s pay frequency rules and your payroll processing.  
   **What to save for your records:** Retain completed W‑4s and I‑9s, copies of documents used for I‑9 verification, a record of each employee’s Social Security number and signed acknowledgments of pay periods and compensation structure.

5. **Secure workers’ compensation insurance and other coverage**  
   **What to do:** Most states require employers with one or more employees to maintain workers’ compensation insurance【378964714632368†L164-L174】. Contact a licensed insurance carrier or state fund to obtain a policy that covers medical treatment and wage replacement for job‑related injuries. If your state allows self‑insurance, verify the requirements before choosing that option【378964714632368†L164-L174】. Consider additional coverage such as disability insurance if required by your state.  
   **What to save for your records:** Keep the policy declarations page, proof of coverage certificates, and any communications with your insurer.

6. **Report new hires to your state directory**  
   **What to do:** Federal law requires employers to report new and rehired employees to the state where they work within 20 days of hire【905240524717134†L215-L221】. Collect and report the employee’s name, address, Social Security number, date of hire and your EIN【905240524717134†L232-L244】. Submit this information via your state’s new hire reporting website or approved method. Multistate employers may register to report new hires to one state.  
   **What to save for your records:** Keep copies or electronic confirmations of the reports submitted, including dates and reference numbers.

7. **Set up payroll processing and deposit schedules**  
   **What to do:** Decide whether to run payroll in‑house or use an external service. Ensure federal employment taxes (income tax, Social Security, Medicare) and state withholding taxes are calculated correctly. Plan deposit schedules (monthly, semi‑weekly or quarterly) based on your projected tax liability. Keep each Form W‑2, W‑3, and quarterly Form 941 or annual Form 944 for federal filing.  
   **What to save for your records:** File copies of all payroll tax returns, deposit confirmations, employee pay stubs, and any payroll service agreements.

8. **Maintain audit‑ready records**  
   **What to do:** Maintain employment tax records for at least four years after filing the fourth quarter tax return【143267306823543†L369-L394】. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), keep basic payroll records such as each employee’s name, Social Security number, address, sex, occupation, hours worked, pay rate, total wages paid and dates of payment【778155936285068†L153-L171】.  
   **What to save for your records:** Organize digital and paper files for easy retrieval during an audit. Document any credits claimed (e.g., employee retention credit), fringe benefits, tip records, and tax deposit acknowledgment numbers【143267306823543†L369-L394】.

## Common mistakes

- **Applying for an EIN before forming your entity.** The IRS advises forming your entity first; otherwise your EIN application may be delayed【245012602743022†L425-L437】.
- **Misclassifying workers as independent contractors.** IRS common‑law rules weigh behavioral, financial and relationship factors; misclassification can result in liability for back taxes【402717181658816†L414-L437】.
- **Failing to register for state unemployment insurance.** States like New York require employers to register when they pay remuneration above small thresholds【575894343363303†L94-L100】.
- **Not collecting Form W‑4 and completing Form I‑9.** All new employees must provide a W‑4 and employers must verify identity and authorization using an I‑9【62666536645171†L373-L379】【62666536645171†L405-L423】.
- **Missing new hire reports.** Employers must report new hires within 20 days; failing to report can lead to state penalties【905240524717134†L215-L221】.
- **Discarding records too soon.** Employment tax records should be kept for at least four years【143267306823543†L369-L394】, and basic payroll records under FLSA must include specific information【778155936285068†L153-L171】.

## FAQ

**When should I apply for an EIN?**  
Apply after your legal entity is formed. The SBA notes that the EIN application is free and should be done right after you register your business【509945751630823†L282-L301】. Applying too early can delay processing【245012602743022†L425-L437】.

**Do I need a state tax ID if my state doesn’t impose income tax?**  
You may still need a state withholding or unemployment insurance account. Many states require employers to register once they pay employees regardless of income tax. Check your state’s tax and labor websites for specific thresholds【575894343363303†L94-L100】.

**What information do I need to report a new hire?**  
Federal law requires you to report the employee’s name, address, Social Security number, date of hire, your business name, address and EIN【905240524717134†L232-L244】. Reports must be submitted within 20 days【905240524717134†L215-L221】.

**How long should I keep payroll records?**  
The IRS recommends keeping employment tax records for at least four years after filing the fourth quarter return【143267306823543†L369-L394】. Under FLSA, employers must keep detailed payroll data such as hours worked, pay rates and deductions【778155936285068†L153-L171】.

**Do I need workers’ compensation insurance?**  
Most states require employers with one or more employees to maintain a workers’ compensation policy【378964714632368†L164-L174】. Contact your state’s labor department or a licensed insurer to confirm requirements and secure coverage.

**What forms do new employees need to fill out?**  
Employees must complete Form W‑4 for withholding and Form I‑9 for employment eligibility verification【62666536645171†L373-L379】【62666536645171†L405-L423】. Employers should also collect any state withholding certificates if applicable.

**How do I determine if a worker is an employee or contractor?**  
The IRS uses common‑law rules focusing on behavioral control, financial control and the type of relationship【402717181658816†L414-L437】. Weigh all factors and document your reasoning. If unsure, you can submit Form SS‑8 to the IRS for a determination.

**Are there penalties for not reporting new hires?**  
Yes. States can impose penalties for late or missing reports. Reporting new hires helps child support agencies locate parents who owe support【905240524717134†L215-L221】, so timely reporting is mandatory.
