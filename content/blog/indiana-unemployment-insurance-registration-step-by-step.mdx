# Register for Indiana Unemployment Insurance: Employer Step-by-Step Guide

If you hire people to work in Indiana, you need to register for unemployment insurance and obtain a state unemployment tax account number (often called a **SUTA number**). This guide walks Indiana small business owners through when registration is required and provides precise steps to create an account through the **Access Indiana/INBiz** portal and the **Department of Workforce Development (DWD) UPLINK** system. It’s written for busy employers who want operational guidance and audit-ready records without fluff.

## Key takeaways

- Indiana employers become liable for unemployment insurance when they pay **$1 or more in remuneration** to a covered worker; agricultural, not-for-profit, and household employers have higher thresholds.
- You must **register with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD)** to report wages, unemployment compensation and new hires.
- **Do not register until you have paid wages** – DWD will not issue a SUTA account number in anticipation of future liability.
- Create an **Access Indiana account via INBiz**, then use the UPLINK Employer Self-Service (ESS) portal to register your unemployment account; you’ll need your FEIN, legal name and company details.
- ESS usernames cannot contain special characters, so **your email address cannot be your username**.
- Save the **registration confirmation**, your **SUTA account number**, and the **new user account confirmation screen** for audit-ready records.

## Who this is for

- Indiana business owners who have hired or plan to hire employees.
- Employers who have acquired an existing business or exited a PEO and need their own unemployment account.
- Owners of agricultural, governmental or not-for-profit entities that meet Indiana UI thresholds (e.g., $20 k in agricultural wages or 10 agricultural workers; four or more employees for 501(c)(3) entities).
- Household employers (individuals or college fraternities/sororities) that pay $1 k or more in cash wages in a quarter.
- Anyone who needs to claim access to an existing DWD account (e.g., after purchasing a business or replacing a prior administrator).

## What you need before you start

- **Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)** – required during ESS registration.
- **Legal entity name and DBA name**, as registered with the Secretary of State.
- **Primary business address**, mailing address and phone number.
- **Contact information for a responsible party** (owner or officer), including name, title and email; keep this consistent with other filings.
- **Date you first paid wages in Indiana** and the date liability was created (e.g., date of acquisition if you purchased a business).
- **Bank account and routing numbers** for future contribution payments (not needed to register but helpful for setting up online payments).
- **Existing SUTA number and last gross wages reported** if you are claiming an existing account.
- **Access to your email** to verify your Access Indiana account and to receive registration confirmations.

## Step-by-step: Register for Indiana Unemployment Insurance

### 1. Confirm that you must register

**What to do:** Determine if your business is liable for unemployment insurance. Indiana considers a regular business entity an employer when it pays **$1 or more in remuneration** to a covered worker. Agricultural employers become liable when they pay **$20,000 in cash wages in a quarter or have 10 or more agricultural employees for at least 20 weeks**. Not-for-profit 501(c)(3) entities are liable when they employ **four or more individuals for 20 weeks**. Household employers must register when they pay **$1,000 or more in a calendar quarter**. Businesses acquiring all or part of another business are automatically liable when the workforce transfers.

**What to save for your records:** Keep a summary of how you determined liability, including payroll records showing when you crossed the threshold and any acquisition documents if you purchased a business.

### 2. Gather required information

**What to do:** Collect the details listed in the “What you need before you start” section. You will enter this information during registration.

**What to save for your records:** Save a single “Employer Setup” folder containing your EIN letter, formation documents, owner/officer details and the date you first paid wages.

### 3. Create an Access Indiana / INBiz account

**What to do:** Go through INBiz to create an Access Indiana account. Use an email address you control long-term (avoid a personal email you may change). Verify your email and log in.

**What to save for your records:** Save the account verification email and any confirmation screen. (A screenshot is fine.)

### 4. Start the UPLINK Employer Self-Service (ESS) registration

**What to do:** From INBiz, navigate to unemployment insurance registration and open the **UPLINK Employer Self-Service (ESS)** portal. Choose the option to register a new employer account (or claim an existing one if you’re taking over an account).

**What to save for your records:** Save the page that confirms you entered the ESS registration flow (screenshots are fine if you can’t download a PDF).

### 5. Choose a compliant ESS username

**What to do:** Create an ESS username that does **not** include special characters. Since special characters are not allowed, your email address usually cannot be used as a username. Pick something you can remember and share internally if needed.

**What to save for your records:** Save your username in your internal credential vault (do not store passwords in plain text). If you use a password manager, store the portal URL, username and recovery method.

### 6. Enter employer details and responsible party information

**What to do:** Complete the employer profile: FEIN, legal name/DBA, entity type, addresses, phone number and responsible party details. Make sure the responsible party matches other filings to reduce mismatch flags later.

**What to save for your records:** Save the completed registration summary if ESS provides one, plus any screen showing the information you entered.

### 7. Submit registration and capture the SUTA number

**What to do:** Submit your registration. Your **SUTA account number** is typically assigned on the confirmation screen. You may also receive a follow-up email or letter.

**What to save for your records:** Save the submission confirmation, the SUTA number, and any “new user account confirmation screen.”

### 8. Set up ongoing reporting and payment reminders

**What to do:** After registration, you’ll need to file wage reports and pay unemployment contributions on the required schedule. Set calendar reminders now so you don’t miss early filings.

**What to save for your records:** Keep copies of quarterly wage reports, payment confirmations and any correspondence in your unemployment account folder.

### 9. If you’re claiming an existing account, complete the claim steps

**What to do:** If you acquired a business or are taking over an employer account, follow the “claim access” steps inside ESS. You may need the existing SUTA number and recent wage amounts.

**What to save for your records:** Save documentation showing authority (purchase docs, officer assignment), the claim confirmation, and any emails confirming the account transfer.

### State-specific notes

Indiana UI registration typically routes through **INBiz (Access Indiana)** and then into **UPLINK Employer Self-Service (ESS)** for unemployment account setup and ongoing reporting. Username constraints in ESS are a common friction point—plan for a non-email username.

## Common mistakes

- **Registering too early.** Indiana generally won’t issue a SUTA account number “in anticipation of liability.”
- **Using inconsistent business names/addresses** compared to your EIN letter or Secretary of State records.
- **Not saving the confirmation screen** that shows the SUTA number.
- **Using an email address you won’t control long-term** (especially if the person leaves the business).
- **Not setting filing reminders** immediately after registration.

## Audit-ready recordkeeping checklist

- [ ] EIN letter (CP 575 or EIN confirmation)
- [ ] Secretary of State formation docs (or comparable legal formation proof)
- [ ] Date you first paid wages in Indiana (payroll register excerpt)
- [ ] INBiz/Access Indiana account verification email
- [ ] ESS registration confirmation screen (with SUTA number)
- [ ] Portal credentials stored in a password manager (no passwords in spreadsheets)
- [ ] Quarterly wage report copies (and confirmations)
- [ ] Payment confirmations for contributions
- [ ] Any DWD correspondence (notices, rate letters, audit letters)

## FAQ

**When do I need to register for Indiana unemployment insurance?**  
You must register once you pay **$1 or more in remuneration** to a covered worker. Agricultural employers register when they pay $20,000 in a quarter or have 10 or more agricultural employees for 20 weeks, and 501(c)(3) entities register when they employ four or more workers for 20 weeks.

**Can I register before I hire my first employee?**  
No. DWD does not register employers “in anticipation of liability.” Only register after you have actually paid someone to work in Indiana.

**How long does it take to get my SUTA account number?**  
Once you complete your ESS registration and submit the required information, your SUTA number is assigned immediately on the confirmation screen. A confirmation email or letter follows within a few days. Delays may occur if information is missing or if your FEIN is already associated with another account.

**What is the unemployment insurance tax rate for new Indiana employers?**  
Most new employers pay **2.5 %** of taxable wages for their first four years. Construction employers pay the lesser of **4.0 % or the average construction rate**, and governmental employers pay **1.6 %**. After 36 consecutive months of liability and consistent reporting, your rate will be based on your experience.

**Do out-of-state employers need to register if they employ remote workers in Indiana?**  
Yes. If you have employees working in Indiana, you are considered an employer for Indiana SUTA purposes and must register, even if your business is located elsewhere. Out-of-state employers should also consult Indiana’s Department of Revenue about withholding taxes.

**How do I grant my payroll provider access to my account?**  
Within ESS, go to **Maintain Account → User Information**, expand **External Account Authorizations (Agent)** and click **Add Agent**. Enter your provider’s agent ID, select the appropriate authorization (such as wage records) and submit.

**Why does the ESS username have to be unique?**  
ESS requires unique usernames and does not allow special characters or email addresses. If the username you choose is already in use, append numbers or letters until you get a unique name.

**Are voluntary elections available for exempt organizations?**  
Yes. Some exempt entities, such as churches or other organizations that are not automatically liable, may elect to be covered by SUTA and pay unemployment taxes. This election covers all workers except those specifically excluded (e.g., clergy).
